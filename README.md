- 👋 Hi, I’m @danaw82
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to become a Web Developer. I have not narrowed down if I want to be a front end or back end developer yet. But I suppose it depends on what I am better at.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and a few other things using Angela Yu's 2023 Complete Web Development Bootcamp. I also hope intend to start on a Bachelor's Program for Web Developmentin the Fall 2024.
- 💞️ I’m not starting to collaborate on anything quite yet. As I am still rather new to this.
- 📫 If anyone would like to reach me I can be contacted at dwildy82@gmail.com.
